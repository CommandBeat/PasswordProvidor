# PasswordProvidor
This is the source code of the Python library, PasswordProvidor.

## Usage
I do not expect this to be used anywhere other than small projects.
You **are** allowed to use this *anywhere* **you** want.
I do not expect any reference about this **but** you are allowed to reference me when using this.

## License
I would prefer if you didn't edit the main code but you **can** change it.
I will be using the [**MIT LICENSE**](https://mit-license.org/) for this project.

## Credit
There is none, not here.

## Notes
Try not to make an entire other Python library with **my** code.
